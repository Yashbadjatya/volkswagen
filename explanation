Code Explanation:
Data Simulation:

We generate a sample dataset using numpy.random to simulate sensor data such as engine temperature, tire pressure, brake wear, oil level, and vehicle age.
The failure_in_next_30_days column represents whether the vehicle is expected to fail within the next 30 days.
Data Preprocessing:

We separate the features (X) and target variable (y) and split the data into training and test sets using train_test_split.
Model Training:

We use a Random Forest Classifier (RandomForestClassifier) for training the model on the sensor data.
Model Evaluation:

After training, we make predictions on the test set and evaluate the model using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix.
Feature Importance:

We visualize which features (sensor data points) are most important in predicting vehicle failures.
Model Saving and Deployment:

The trained model is saved using joblib, and we demonstrate how it can be loaded for future predictions. The model can be integrated into an Edge AI system or uploaded to a cloud platform for real-time monitoring and alerts.
Next Steps for Real-World Implementation:
Data Collection: Replace the simulated data with actual sensor data from vehicles.
Model Optimization: Fine-tune the model, use more advanced techniques, and incorporate real-time data for continuous training and improvement.
Integration with Cloud/Edge AI: Deploy the model to the edge (within the vehicle) or a cloud platform for continuous monitoring, with alerts sent to vehicle owners or fleet managers.
Continuous Monitoring: Set up a system where the model is periodically retrained with fresh data to improve its predictions over time.
This is a basic but functional implementation of an AI-powered predictive maintenance system. It can be expanded with more sophisticated models, real-time data, and integrated into a fully operational fleet management system.
